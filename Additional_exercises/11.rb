I dont feel too qualified to answer this yet and hopefully will have a much more detailed and appropriate answer to this question in the coming months as my learning exelerates but currently I guess I like the "Time" and "Date" resources. I think it is neat that we can access and include time and date references in our code that will update and keep track of themselves and that have complete and accurate ideas of what occured in the past and what will occur in the future in terms of date and time.  Very neat feature.
