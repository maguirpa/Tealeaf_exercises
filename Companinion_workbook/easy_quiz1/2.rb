# There are big differences between '!' and '?' in Ruby.  '!' can mean to negate something or change it from its current conditional from true to false or vice versa.  !true means false and !false means true.  ! can also be used at the end of certain methods to make them go from changing an array or hash in place to mutating it permanently.  It needs to be used carefully in those instances. 

# 1)  != means "not true".  You can use it in while loops or conditionals or anywhere within your code to control the flow of information.

# 2)  Means "Not user_name"

# 3)  not sure what this means after the paramenter is passed.

# 4)  ?  before something is usually the ternary operater to check if something is true or false.

# 5) ? after something means that the code will check if it is true or false and proceed accordingly.

# 6)  I dont think this means anything.
